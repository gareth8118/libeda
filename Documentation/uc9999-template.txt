== AsciiDoc Markup ==

This document is written in AsciiDoc.

____________________________________________________________________
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, blogs and UNIX man
pages.  AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including
HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the
AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can
be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended
by the user.

== General form for a use case ==

In general, a use case should be expressed in the form:

[verse]
As a $PERSON
I want $FEATURE
so that $BENEFIT.

It should usually be possible to express a use case in a short
sentence.  If you find that difficult, it is often a sign that your
use case might need to be split into a number of separate use cases.

After the initial statement of the use case, you should then give as
much detail and as many examples of that use case as you like!  Images
illustrating what you want to do would be especially useful for
helping readers understand the use case.

== Adding your new use case into the document ==

To add your newly-written use case into the main use-case document,
you need to do two things.

1. Name it correctly.  Each use case file should be called
   +ucXXYY-description.txt+, where +XX+ is the number of the section
   in the use case document that you want the use case to appear in,
   and +YY+ is the number of the use case within that section.  If you
   have extra files associated with your use case (e.g. images), their
   filenames should all start with the same +ucXXYY-+ prefix.  To find
   out what values of +XX+ are used, look in +use-cases.sh+.  Feel
   free to add new sections to the document if there's no appropriate
   one there yet.

2. Add your use case file (and any extra files) to the +USE_CASES+
   list in +Makefile.am+.

// Local Variables:
// mode: adoc
// End:
