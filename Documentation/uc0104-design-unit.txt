=== Notion of a Design Unit ===

As someone who frequently exchanges parts of designs, I would the tool to
have a notion of a "design unit" (an "entity", a "cell") which encompasses
both the interface (a symbol) and an implementation (schematic, netlist,
primitive model, etc.).

This is the level of abstraction at which the list of ports, list
of attributes, a cell name should be defined. The tool should enforce
their integrity across both the symbol and all implementations referring
to these data.
