=== Basic Hierarchy ===

As an engineer who frequently works on designs with identical
subcircuits, I want support for repeating a subsection within my
design so that I save time otherwise spent drawing the same circuit
repeatedly.

An example of a situation I have encountered in which this feature
would be very useful was a digital signal generator with 64 outputs
divided into 8 banks of 8 outputs each, with each of the banks having
a separate programmable power supply.

With basic hierarchy support available, I would draw:

. A schematic for a single line driver.
. A schematic for a bank of outputs, which contains a power supply and
  8 instances of the line driver schematic.
. A top-level schematic, which containts eight instances of the output
  bank schematic.

This would save an enormous amount of work.
