=== Annotation in subcircuits ===

As someone who works with assembly houses who demand flat numbering, I
want my schematic editor to support annotation across hierarchy, so
that I can use repeated subcircuits in my designs _and_ be able to
view the actual board numbering in my editor.

Some assembly houses impose unreasonable requirements on component
numbering, such as "components must be sequentially numbered starting
from the top right corner of the board."  Currently, the
gschem->gnetlist->PCB workflow doesn't support this without hacks such
as a separate hierarchical refdes to flat refdes mapping file applied
during the netlisting process.

If support for this was built into the schematic editor and underlying
document model, the annotated version of a circuit could be viewed in
the schematic editor and the annotations edited, and cross-probing
from the PCB editor could be made to work nicely.

[NOTE]
This use-case should include example diagrams.
