=== Circuit Libraries for Design Re-Use ===

As someone who regularly works on designs which need similar
functions, I want to be able to build up a library of reusable
subcircuits so that I can quickly assemble a new design from tried and
tested functional blocks.

The library should form a local namespace or a hierarchy of local namespaces,
with possibility of addressing them both in terms of absolute and relative path names.
This is to encourage design reuse and limit possibility of naming conflicts.

Several examples where this would be useful:

1. USB interface & power supply subcircuit for USB bus-powered
   devices.  This reusable subcircuit might include a USB type A
   socket, all of the necessary passives, and an indicator LED.

2. General switching PSU subcircuits (e.g. inverting power supply,
   mains to 5V power supply).

3. Input buffer and output line driver subcircuits when working on
   related analogue audio processing module designs.
