=== Notion of a Design ===

As someone who regularly works on large designs, I want to the tool
to treat all design-wide data and configurations as a single entity.
In particular, the tool accessing the design data should be able to
efficiently traverse and transform the hierarchy of unit design blocks,
and connectivity within the whole design.

The design is different from a design unit e.g. a schematic in that
it may consist of more than just one design unit, either hierarchical
or not (e.g. a schematic page).

The design is different from a library in that it has a single "main entity",
a root design unit, and matches the structure of an actual design (hence the name).

The design should be the definite method of accessing following information:
1. Hierarchy or set on non-hierarchical design units, ideally the hierarchy should
   form a directed acyclic graph to enable fast traversal and transformations.
2. Types of design units
3. Connectivity across the whole design, ideally this should form a directed
   acyclic graph to enable fast traversal and transformations.
4. Configuration of the design, in particular any information related to annotation,
   overriding attributes, selecting alternative implementations of design units,
   selecting different design units.
5. Design specific settings, with a possibility of overriding them by the user.
