=== Homogeneous Buses ===

As an engineer who works with wide address and data buses, I want to
be able to draw homogeneous buses so that I don't have to draw every
wire in a bus everywhere that it is used.

An example of where this would be very useful would be connecting up a
number of identical flash memory chips to an FPGA.  I would like to be
able to draw a subcircuit schematic containing a single flash chip and
any associated passives (e.g. pull-up resistors and power decoupling
caps), and give the subcircuit `ADDRESS[23:0]' and `DATA[31:0]' bus
ports.  I could then instantiate the circuit as many times as needed,
and would only need to hook up the buses to each instance, rather than
having to connect every one of the 56 control lines to each flash chip
individually.
