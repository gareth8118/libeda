=== Text file line-endings ===

As an engineer who has to collaborate with colleagues using Windows
as well as Linux, I often need to exchange design files between
platforms which use `\n' and `\r\n' line-endings.

It is sometimes convenient to hand-edit our design files, and it would
be useful to ensure that the EDA tools can cope with either line ending
when reading the design file.

Furthermore - if the tools save output using the platform preferred
line ending, editing is easier using native tools without having the
burden of converting using the +dos2unix+ or +unix2dos+ command line
tools.
